The goal of the qLibc project is to provide a **simple and powerful general purpose C/C++ library** that includes all kinds of containers and general library routines. It provides a ready-made set of common container APIs with a consistent API look.\r\n\r\n## qLibc Copyright\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1.

It basically provides a creator function which usually returns a pointer to a container structure. Also, **all functions related to the container can be accessed through function pointers inside of the container**.\r\n\r\nSo, regardless of which container you use, you can simply put elements into a list with `pContainer->put(pContainer, ...)`. It looks like C++ classes, but it's a pure C implementation. Of course, it works with both C and C++ code**.\r\n\r\nWe use this concept as much as possible because it is a simplified way of thinking and helps to improve readability. Consequently, it helps people to write bug-free code more easily.\r\n\r\nThe example below illustrates qlibc in action:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n  // create a hash-table.\r\n  qhashtbl_t *tbl = qhashtbl(0, QHASHTBL_OPT_THREADSAFE);\r\n  \r\n  // add an element which key name is \"score\".\r\n  int x = 12345;\r\n  tbl->put(tbl, \"score\", &x, sizeof(int));\r\n  \r\n  // get the value of the element.\r\n  int *px = tbl->get(tbl, \"score\");\r\n  if(px != NULL) {\r\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", *px);\r\n    free(px);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // release table\r\n  tbl->free(tbl);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an identical implementation with a Linked-List-Table container.\r\nYou may notice that there aren't any code changes at all, except for 1 line in the table creation.\r\nThis is why qLibc encapsulates corresponding function pointers inside of the container object.\r\n\r\n```C\r\n  // create a linked-list-table. THE ONLY LINE YOU NEED TO CHANGE.\r\n  qlisttbl_t *tbl = qlisttbl(QLISTTBL_OPT_THREADSAFE);\r\n  \r\n  // add an element which key name is \"score\".\r\n  int x = 12345;\r\n  tbl->put(tbl, \"score\", &x, sizeof(int));\r\n  \r\n  // get the value of the element.\r\n  int *px = tbl->get(tbl, \"score\");\r\n  if(px != NULL) {\r\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", *px);             \r\n    free(px);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // release table\r\n  tbl->free(tbl);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Looking for people to work with.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for people who want to work together to develop and improve qLibc.\r\nCurrently, we have high demands on following areas.\r\n\r\n* Automated testing\r\n* Documentation.\r\n* New feature implementation.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThe following people have helped with suggestions, ideas, code or fixing bugs:\r\n(in alphabetical order by first name)\r\n\r\n* Anthony Tseng\r\n* Cesar\r\n* Colin\r\n* Dmitry Vorobiev\r\n* HyoSup Woo\r\n* Keith Rosenberg\r\n* Krishna\r\n* Luis Jimenez\r\n* Maik Beckmann\r\n* RQ\r\n* Ryan Gonzalez\r\n* Seungyoung Kim\r\n* Umesh\r\n* Zhongchao Liu\r\n\r\nIf we have forgotten or misspelled your name, please let us know.\r\n","google":"UA-8949829-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
