{"name":"qLibc Project","tagline":"The goal of qLibc project is to provide a simple but powerful general purpose C/C++ library.","body":"What's qLibc?\r\n=============\r\n\r\nqLibc is currently one of the most functionally complete public licensed C/C++ libraries. The goal of qLibc project is to provide a **simple and powerful general purpose C/C++ library** which includes all kinds of containers and general library routines. It provides ready-made set of common container APIs with consistant API look.\r\n\r\n## qLibc Copyright\r\n\r\nAll of the deliverable code in qLibc has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original qLibc code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means. \r\n\r\n## API Reference\r\n\r\n* [qlibc Core API Reference](http://wolkykim.github.io/qlibc/doc/html/files.html)\r\n  * Containers\r\n    * List --- Doubly Linked List.\r\n    * List Table --- KEY/VALUE paired table implemented on linked-list.\r\n    * Hash Table --- Hash based KEY/VALUE paired table.\r\n    * Static Hash Table --- Static(array/mmapped/shared) memory based KEY/VALUE paired table.\r\n    * Vector --- implements a growable array of elements.\r\n    * Queue --- FIFO(First In First Out) implementation.\r\n    * Stack --- LIFO(Last In First Out) implementation.\r\n  * General utilities.\r\n    * String\r\n    * I/O\r\n    * File\r\n    * IPC, Semaphore Shared-memory\r\n    * En/decoders\r\n    * Hashes\r\n    * System\r\n    * Time\r\n\r\n* [qLibc Extension API Reference](http://wolkykim.github.io/qlibc/doc/html/files.html)\r\n  * INI-style Configuration File Parser.\r\n  * Apache-style Configuration File Parser.\r\n  * Rotating File Logger.\r\n  * HTTP client.\r\n  * Database(MySQL) interface.\r\n  * Token-Bucket.\r\n\r\n## Consistant API Look\r\n\r\nAll container APIs have constant look, basically it provides a creator function which usually returns a pointer of a container structure. And **every functions related to the container can be accessed through function pointers inside of the container**.\r\n\r\nSo regardless of what container you use, you can simple put elements into list like pContainer->put(pContainer, ...). It looks like C++ class but it's pure C implementation. Of course it works with both of your C and C++ codes**.\r\n\r\nWe used this concept as much as possible because it simplifies the thinking way and helps to improve readability. Consequently it helps people to write bugless codes more easily.\r\n \r\nSee the example below to see how it works.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // create a hash-table.\r\n  qhashtbl_t *tbl = qhashtbl(0, QHASHTBL_OPT_THREADSAFE);\r\n  \r\n  // add an element which key name is \"score\".\r\n  int x = 12345;\r\n  tbl->put(tbl, \"score\", &x, sizeof(int));\r\n  \r\n  // get the value of the element.\r\n  int *px = tbl->get(tbl, \"score\");\r\n  if(px != NULL) {\r\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", *px);\r\n    free(px);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // release table\r\n  tbl->free(tbl);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an identical implementation with Linked-List-Table container.\r\nYou might noticed that there's no code change entirely except of 1 line for the table creation.\r\nThis is why qLibc encapsulates corresponding function pointers inside the container object.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // create a linked-list-table. THE ONLY LINE YOU NEED TO CHANGE.\r\n  qlisttbl_t *tbl = qlisttbl(QLISTTBL_OPT_THREADSAFE);\r\n  \r\n  // add an element which key name is \"score\".\r\n  int x = 12345;\r\n  tbl->put(tbl, \"score\", &x, sizeof(int));\r\n  \r\n  // get the value of the element.\r\n  int *px = tbl->get(tbl, \"score\");\r\n  if(px != NULL) {\r\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", *px);             \r\n    free(px);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // release table\r\n  tbl->free(tbl);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Looking for people to work with.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for people who want to work together developing and improving qLibc.\r\nCurrently, we have high demands on following areas.\r\n\r\n* Automated testing\r\n* Documentation.\r\n* New feature implementation.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
